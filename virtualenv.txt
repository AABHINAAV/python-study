// to install the virtual environment module in system-----
pip3 install virtualenv

virtualenv abhi

// now it has installed all basic and predefined modules in that newly created python environment
// if we want some extra module in it then we can install them using 
pip3 install module_name

//////but if we want to create such environment that has all packages of outer most environment
virtualenv --system-site-packages environment_name

//if we want list of modules(requirements) of that virtual environment
'pip freeze > filename.txt'
pip freeze > requirements.txt
it will create text file with names and version of extra installed modules
use above command again to update file

//to activate v-environment
source ./abhi/bin/activate   ---> linux / mac
./abhi/Scripts/activate   ---> windows

//now we are inside python virtual environment
'python' ---> to access the newly created python

//if a file has thousands of module then to install them one by one is pain in ass so we use
'pip3 install -r filename.txt'
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
it will install all required modules of that virtual environment

//to get out of virtual environment
deactivate
